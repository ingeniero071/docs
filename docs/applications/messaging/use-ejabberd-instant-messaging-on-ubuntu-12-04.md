[Ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/) is a Jabber daemon written in the Erlang programming language. It is extensible, flexible and very high performance. With a web-based interface and broad support for [XMPP standards](http://xmpp.org/), ejabberd is a great choice for a multi-purpose XMPP server. It can be considered "heavyweight" by critics because of the requirements of the Erlang runtimes. However, it is incredibly robust and can scale to support incredibly heavy loads. Its servers are believed to be the backbone for some of the largest Jabber servers currently running.

This installation process assumes that you have a working installation of Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), have followed the steps in the [getting started](/docs/getting-started/) guide, and now have an up-to-date instance of the Ubuntu 12.04 operating system. We also assume you are connected to your Linode via SSH as a non-root user, so be sure to use `sudo` when editing configuration files.

## XMPP/Jabber Basics

Though you can successfully run an XMPP server with only a passing familiarity of the way the XMPP network and system works, understanding the following basic concepts will be helpful:

-   The *JID* (Jabber ID), is the unique identifier for a user in the XMPP network. It often looks like an email and contains the username that identifies a specific user on a server, the hostname that identifies the server, and a resource that identifies from where a given user is logged in. The resource is optional and is often safely omitted or ignored by most users. In the following example, "username" is the username, "example.com" is the hostname, and "/office" is the resource.

        username@example.com/office

    Again, the resource is optional; although XMPP allows a single JID to be connected to the server from multiple machines (i.e. resources), the resource adds a useful amount of specificity.

-   The XMPP system is *federated*, meaning users with accounts on one server - if the server administrators allow it - can communicate with users on other servers. Without a centralized server, each XMPP server maintains the accounts and serves as the communication gateway for its own users. In the XMPP system there is no single point of failure; however, each server administrator can decide how his server is going to participate in the federated network. For instance, to federate with Google's "GTalk" XMPP network, server administrators need to have server-to-server (s2s) SSL/TLS encryption enabled, while other servers don't always require this.
-   XMPP takes advantage of ["SRV" DNS records](/docs/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns) to support the resolution of domains to the servers which provide DNS records.

## Install ejabberd

To install ejabberd and its required dependencies, run:

    sudo apt-get install ejabberd

The default installation is complete and functional. The installation process creates a self-signed SSL certificate. If you want to use a commercially signed certificate, place the certificate file at `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem`. Most of the time a self-signed certificate is sufficient.

If you have not already configured your `/etc/hosts` as follows, please do so before you continue. Please see our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/) for more information on this.

With the hostname configured, you're ready to begin configuring ejabberd.

## Configure ejabberd

The configuration files for ejabberd are written in Erlang syntax, which might be difficult to follow. Thankfully, the modifications we need to make are relatively minor and straightforward. The main ejabberd configuration file is located at `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg`. 

### Administrative Users

Some users will need the ability to administer the XMPP server remotely. By default, this block of the config file looks like this:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
:   ~~~
    %% Admin user {acl, admin, {user, "", "localhost"}}.
    ~~~

In Erlang, comments begin with the `%` sign, and the Access Control list segment contains information in the following form: `{user, "username", "hostname"}`. The following examples correspond to the users with the JIDs of `admin@example.com` and `username@example.com`. You only need to specify one administrator, but you can add more than one simply by adding additional lines, as shown below:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
:   ~~~
    {acl, admin, {user, "admin", "example.com"}}.
    {acl, admin, {user, "username", "example.com"}}.
    ~~~

All users specified in this manner have full administrative access to the server through both the XMPP and web-based interfaces. You will have to create your administrative users (as described below) before they can log in.

### Hostnames and Virtual Hosting

A single ejabberd instance can provide XMPP services for multiple domains at once, as long as those domains (or subdomains) are hosted by the server. To add a hostname for virtual hosting in ejabberd, modify the `hosts` option. By default, ejabberd is only configured to host the "localhost" domain:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
:   ~~~
    {hosts, ["localhost"]}.
    ~~~

In the following example, ejabberd has been configured to host a number of additional domains. In this case, "username.example.com," "example.com," and "example2.com."

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
:   ~~~
    {hosts, ["username.example.com", "example.com", "example2.com"]}.
    ~~~

You can specify any number of hostnames in the host list, but you should be careful to avoid inserting a line break, which will cause ejabberd to fail.

### Listening Ports

The conventional port for XMPP is 5222. 

You may want to enable SSL access for client-to-server (c2s) SSL/TLS connections if you or the other users of you are using a client that requires legacy support for secured connections on port 5223. Uncomment the following stanza to do so:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
:   ~~~
    {5223, ejabberd_c2s, [
        {access, c2s},
        {shaper, c2s_shaper},
        {max_stanza_size, 65536},
        tls, {certfile, "/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem"}
     ]},
    ~~~

### Additional Functionality

The `ejabberd.cfg` file is complete and well commented; from this point forward your server should run. However, you should take the time to become familiar with the options provided in this file.

By default, MUCs or Multi-User-Chats (chatrooms) are accessible on the "conference.hostname" sub-domain, where your hostname is substituted for `hostname`. If you want the public to be able to access MUCs on your domain, you need to create an "A Record" pointing to the `conference` hostname (i.e. subdomain) to the IP address where the ejabberd instance is running.

## How to Use ejabberd

Once installed, the use and configuration of ejabberd is simple. To start, stop or restart the server, issue the appropriate command from the following:

    sudo /etc/init.d/ejabberd start
    sudo /etc/init.d/ejabberd stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/ejabberd restart

By default, ejabberd is configured to disallow "in-band-registrations," which prevents Internet users from creating accounts on your server without your permission. To register a new user, issue a command in the following form:

    ejabberdctl register username example.com password

In this example, `username` is the username, `example.com` is the domain, and `password` is the password. This will create a JID for `username@example.com` with the password of "password". Use this form to create the administrative users specified above.

To remove a user from your server, issue a command in the following form:

    ejabberdctl unregister username example.com

To set or reset the password for a user, issue the following command:

    ejabberdctl set-password username example.com morris

This command changes the password for the `username@example.com` user to `morris`.

To back up ejabberd's database, issue the following command:

    ejabberdctl dump ejabberd-backup.db

This command dumps the contents of the internal ejabberd database into a file located in the "/var/lib/ejabberd/" directory. To restore from the backup, issue the following command:

    ejabberdctl load ejabberd-backup.db

For more information about the `ejabberdctl` command, issue `ejabberdctl help` or `man ejabberdctl`.

If you would prefer to administer your ejabberd instance via the web-based interface, log in to `http://example.com:5280/admin/`, where "example.com" is the domain where ejabberd is running. Log in with the full JID using the username and the password of one of the administrators specified in the `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg` file.

## XMPP Federation and DNS

To ensure that your ejabberd instance will federate properly with the rest of the XMPP network, particularly with Google's "GTalk" service (i.e. the ["@gmail.com](mailto:"@gmail.com)" chat tool), we must set the SRV records for the domain to point to the server where the ejabberd instance is running. We need three records, which can be created in the DNS Management tool of your choice:

1.  Service: `_xmpp-server` Protocol: TCP Port: 5269
2.  Service: `_xmpp-client` Protocol: TCP Port: 5222
3.  Service: `_jabber` Protocol: TCP Port: 5269

The "target" of the SRV record should point to the publicly routable hostname for that machine (e.g. "username.example.com"). The priority and weight should both be set to `0`.

## Troubleshooting

The logs for ejabberd are located in the `/var/log/ejabberd/` directory. If you're getting error messages look in these files, particularly `ejabberd.log` and `sasl.log`. Additionally, if ejabberd crashes, the "image dump" of Erlang will be saved in this directory. Begin your investigations for error messages in these files.

Furthermore, ejabberd's "Mnesia" database is stored in the `/var/lib/ejabberd/` directory. If you think the database has become corrupted, delete the files in this directory (e.g. `rm /var/lib/ejabberd/*`) and reload from a backup, if necessary. This is sometimes required if the hostname of the local machine changes.
